<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This quinoa salad is a great summertime recipe (or anytime you want
 to feel like it's summertime). Light and citrusy, it's a whole new way to enjoy quinoa.
 Lime juice and cilantro give a refreshing kick, while quinoa and black beans provide
tasty vegan protein. If you're not vegan, add even more protein by adding chunks of
chicken or turkey. This salad tastes great right away and even better the next day
 when all the flavors have had the chance to marry.</p>
