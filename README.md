# odin-recipes
First Odin project

Practice all of the HTML knowledge acquired. In this project, we will build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished.

This project is just to build HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
